# publication-standard

The future publication standard (occasionally referred to as "Standard 2.0") can be described as the centrepiece of the official gazette portal. The standard to be established essentially involves a new, generic schema.

## Why a standard?

The growing number of official publications in the official gazette portal shows that the introduction of a standard that applies to all types of publications is unavoidable. A standardised reporting structure offers a number of advantages:

- A uniform standard ensures the interoperability of the system.  It furthermore ensures that the publications remain readable and processable at a future time.
- The import and export of publications is simplified and each publication type can be processed in the same way.
- The schemes are easier to read once the basic principles have been understood.
- The new publication structure follows universal semantics that apply to all publication types. Wherever possible, the schema structure is based on the existing eCH standards.

## Considerations regarding the standard

In recent years, various preparatory work has been carried out for the introduction of a new, holistic standard. In particular

* A minimum set of metadata common to all publications was defined. This set will enable a standardised search of both published and archived notifications in the future. The meta data standard can be found here.

* a generic structure for message content was created. This makes it possible to deliver and obtain notifications of different notification types and public authorities in a standardised structure.
